## Reactor Data Spoofer

Simply, this Arduino file will simulate reactor dat and send it. It's primarily used for the user interface but can be extended to other areas if needed.

Currently, there are three datatypes being simulated:

 * Temperature (Mixer, Inflow, Outflow, Reactor)
 * Flow Rate (Argon, H20, C02, Methane)
 * Scale Weight (Water)
